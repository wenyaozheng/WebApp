<h3>Bachelor of Science in Medical Technology&nbsp;</h3>
<img src = "./resources/medtech.jpg">
<p>A four year program consisting of general education and professional courses such as Chemistry, Biological Sciences and Mathematics. The program also includes internship training in tertiary level hospital-based clinical laboratory recognized by CHED for such purpose in its fourth year. The internship training includes rotational duties in different sections of the laboratory such as Clinical Chemistry, Hematology, Microbiology, Immunohematology, Immunology , Serology, Urinalysis and Other Body Fluids, Histopathologic and Cytopathologic techniques and other emergent technologies.</p>

<h2>Subjects and Curriculum</h2><br>

The subjects in the BSMedTech curriculum are divided into four main categories:

<ul class="ConText">
  
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">General Education Courses</span>: Language and Humanities Cluster, Mathematics, Computer and Natural Science Cluster, Social Sciences Cluster, Mandated Subjects</li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Basic Courses</span>: Introduction to Medical Technology with Science, Technology and Society (STS), Anatomy &amp; Physiology, Community and Public Health, Principles and Strategies of Teaching in Health Education</li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Core Courses</span>: Biological Science, Chemistry, Qualitative and Quantitative Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry</li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Professional Courses</span>: Microbiology, Bacteriology, Mycology/Virology, Clinical Chemistry, Routine Clinical Chemistry, Special Chemistry, Endocrinology, Toxicology And Drug Testing, Histology, Analysis of Urine and Other Body Fluids (Clinical Microscopy), Pharmacology, Cytogenetics, Med Tech Laws &amp; Bioethics, Laboratory Management, Parasitology, Immunology &amp; Serology, Immunohematology (Blood Banking), Hematology, General Pathology, Histopathologic/Cytologic Techniques, Research 1 (Introduction to Research), Research 2 (Research Paper Writing), Special topics on Medical Laboratory Science</li>

</ul><br>

<p>Students of the BSMedTech program spend most of their time in the classroom listening to lectures and inside the laboratory doing practicum exercises. They are able to learn the different clinical laboratory tests through return demonstrations. Clinical Instructors will perform the procedure first, afterwards, students will have the chance to do the procedures themselves and will be graded based on a performance rating scale.<br></p>
<img class = "studs" src ="./resources/medstuds.jpg">

<br>

<p>In the fourth year of the program, students need to complete a research paper. Once finished, they will defend their work infront of a panel and will be graded on a certain criteria. The second semester of the fourth year level is the internship program in an accredited training laboratory with rotational duties in the different sections such as Clinical Chemistry, Hematology, Microbiology, Immunohematology, Immunology and Serology, Urinalysis and Body Fluids, Parasitology and Histopathology.</p><br>
